# Chicago Crime Predicitions using various methods.
## First Method using Caret
Due to the amount of data we are using, trying to predict arrests using a local run we run out of memory to process this request. We have to use SparklyR now to compute this. 
## Second method using sparklyR
WE are going to essentially copy the data cleaning from our caret method but using only dplyr functions, this has caused us to change some things minimally but in the end it will turn out the same. (currently on EDA)
